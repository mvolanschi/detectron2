# Panoptic Segmentation with Detectron2

This project demonstrates panoptic segmentation using Detectron2, a high-performance computer vision library built by Facebook AI Research. Panoptic segmentation is a task that combines semantic segmentation (assigning a class label to each pixel) and instance segmentation (detecting and segmenting individual objects) in a single unified framework.

## Features:
- Utilizes pre-trained models from the COCO dataset for panoptic segmentation tasks.
- Demonstrates how to perform panoptic segmentation on custom images using Detectron2.
- Visualizes the panoptic segmentation results using Matplotlib for easy interpretation.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.8
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- Detectron2

## Usage:
1. Install the required dependencies (`opencv-python`, `matplotlib`, `detectron2`).
2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
3. Modify the image path in the provided script to point to your desired image.
4. Run the script to perform panoptic segmentation on the image and visualize the results.
